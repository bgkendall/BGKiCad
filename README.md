# BGKiCad

My set of KiCad symbols and footprints.

## Footprints

The library provides the following footprints:

#### D_SOD-123

A happy medium between KiCadâ€™s footprints `D_SOD-323` (pads are too small) and
`D_SOD-323_HandSoldering` (pads are too big).

Number of pads: 2

#### SW_Choc_v1_HS_CPG135001S30_1u_Reversible**

Reversible hotswap footprint for Kailh Choc style switches (adapted from [Marbastlib]).

Number of pads: 2

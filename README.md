# BGKiCad

My set of KiCad symbols and footprints.

## Footprints

The library provides the following footprints:

| Footprint Name | No. Pads | Description
| :------------- | :------: | :----------
| **D_SOD-123**  |     2    | A happy medium between KiCadâ€™s footprints `D_SOD-323` (pads are too small) and `D_SOD-323_HandSoldering` (pads are too big).

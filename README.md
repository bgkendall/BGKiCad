# BGKiCad

My set of KiCad symbols and footprints.

## Footprints

The library provides the following footprints:

 * **D_SOD-123** {2} — A happy medium between KiCad’s footprints `D_SOD-323` (pads are too
   small) and `D_SOD-323_HandSoldering` (pads are too big).
 * **SW_choc_v1_HS_CPG135001S30_1u_Reversible** — Reversible hotswap footprint for Kailh
   Choc style switches (adapted from [Marbastlib](https://github.com/ebastler/marbastlib)).

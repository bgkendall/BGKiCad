# BGKiCad

My set of KiCad symbols and footprints.

## Footprints

The library provides the following footprints:

#### D_SOD-123

A happy medium between KiCad’s footprints `D_SOD-323` (pads are too small) and
`D_SOD-323_HandSoldering` (pads are too big).

Pad count: 2

#### SW_Choc_v1_HS_CPG135001S30_1u_Reversible, …1.25u_Reversible, …1.5u_Reversible

Reversible hotswap footprints for Kailh Choc style switches (adapted from [Marbastlib]),
with 1U, 1¼U and 1½U margins.

Pad count: 2
